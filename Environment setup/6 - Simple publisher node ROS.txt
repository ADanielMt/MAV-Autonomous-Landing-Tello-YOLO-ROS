			Save
		In Terminal Tab -> New Terminal:
			cd tello_ws/src/first_pkg/src ## Go to package src folder (or publisher node folder)
			chmod +x talker.py ## Give execution privileges to publisher node (talker.py)

			cd tello_ws ## Go to home of workspace
			catkin_make  ## Complile project 
			## If error in compilation (related to std_msgs.msg package):
